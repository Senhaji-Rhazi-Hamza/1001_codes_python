The exercice is about circuit constructed by a repeated  mesh, we know as datas, the values of 
the generator, and the resistances, the aim is to know the curent ik  in each mesh, 

with applying node law and mesh law we obtain a linear system like that

i0 = E/R


{   
 i0 - 4i1 + i2 = 0 L(k)


 ik - 4ik+1 + ik+2 = 0 L(k)
	 .
	 .
	 .
		
until last mesh wich has a diferent expression in-1 + 3in = 0
}


the analytic solution is solved by sequence of second order 
ik = E/R* (2- sqrt(3)^k
the computational solution is solved by gauss algorithm
######################################################################
there are presented 2 method of solving linear problem

gauss.py -->the method : elimination of gauss

fact_lu.py--> factorization LU normal case and the case where the pivot
 is equal to are presented

test.py --> use both of numerical solution and analytical one, then 
compare them with a plot

Explanation of gauss method


A : matrix belong to MnR 
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
B : vector known

system   Ax = B

##Start solving

the idea is to transform the system with linears combinations to obtain 
another system Ux = C, this system have the same asolution as Ax=B
but in this system U is a triangular matrix inferior or superior 
we prefer to choose it superior here
the system become something liket that 

a11*x1 + a12*x2 + ........+ a1n*xn = c1
       + a22*x2 + ........+ a2n*xn = c2
                + ........+ a3n*xn = c3
                     .
                     .
                     .
                     .
                     .
                            ann*xn = cn


it become easy to solve starting from solving xn

xi = (ci - sum( aij * xj)) / aii   | from j = 1 to i - 1
