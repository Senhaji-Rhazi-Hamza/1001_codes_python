in this exercice it is not pertinent to explain the physical phenomena.
we are interested in knowing method of solving linear systems, so i will
focus just on the methods which we will explain:
      -Jacobi Method
      -Gauss Seidel Method
      -Gradient Method
      -Gradient convergent method

#####################################################################
##1-Jacobi Method

let imagine we have a system writen Ax = b 

A : matrix belong to MnR symetric and Diagonal strict(means |aii| > sum(aij) with i!=j)
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
b : vector known

##Start solving

so let decompose A = D - E - F

D : Diagonal matrix
E : Triangular inferior Matrix
F : Triangular superior Matrix

so the new equation will be (D-E-F)x=b <=> Dx =(E+F)x + b
                                       <=> x =D(-1)(E+F)x + D(-1)b
                                       <=> x =(I - D(-1)A) x + D(-1)b
                                       <=> x =B x + f

with D(-1) is the inverse of D, B = (I - D(-1)A) and f = D(-1)b

so the beautiful idea is to think that a sequence of vectors Un exist
that     Verify Un+1 = B*Un + f and  that Un converge to the x we are 
trying to find 

we have a theorem who says that under
some conditions Un converge to the x 

we chose U0 for example(1,1.(n-3)times,1) and we iterate until Un+1 -Un tends to Epsilon
close to 0 then our Un+1 is our x

##2- Gauss Seidel Method

this method is nearly as the same as jacobi method, we just choose diferent
matrix to iterate the sequence.

let imagine we have a system writen Ax = b 

A : matrix belong to MnR defined positiv
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
b : vector known

##Start solving

so let decompose A = D - E - F

D : Diagonal matrix
E : Triangular inferior Matrix
F : Triangular superior Matrix

we put P = D - E is also a triangular inferior matrix

with P(-1) is the inverse of P,  B = P(-1)F and f = P(-1)b
so the new equation will be (D-E-F)x=b <=>  (D - E)x = Fx + b
                                       <=>       Px = Fx + b
                                       <=>        x = P(-1)Fx + P(-1)b
                                       <=>        x = B x + f

we just need that A to be defined and positiv to have convergence
