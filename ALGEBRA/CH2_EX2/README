in this exercice it is not pertinent to explain the physical phenomena.
we are interested in knowing method of solving linear systems, so i will
focus just on the methods which we will explain:
      -Jacobi Method
      -Gauss Seidel Method
      -Gradient Method
      -Gradient convergent method

#####################################################################
##1-Jacobi Method

let imagine we have a system writen Ax = b 

A : matrix belong to MnR symetric and Diagonal strict(means |aii| > sum(aij) with i!=j)
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
b : vector known

##Start solving

so let decompose A = D - E - F

D : Diagonal matrix
E : Triangular inferior Matrix
F : Triangular superior Matrix

so the new equation will be (D-E-F)x=b <=> Dx =(E+F)x + b
                                       <=> x =D(-1)(E+F)x + D(-1)b
                                       <=> x =(I - D(-1)A) x + D(-1)b
                                       <=> x =B x + f

with D(-1) is the inverse of D, B = (I - D(-1)A) and f = D(-1)b

so the beautiful idea is to think that a sequence of vectors Un exist
that     Verify Un+1 = B*Un + f and  that Un converge to the x we are 
trying to find 

we have a theorem who says that under
some conditions Un converge to the x 

we chose U0 for example(1,1.(n-3)times,1) and we iterate until Un+1 -Un tends to Epsilon
close to 0 then our Un+1 is our x

#####################################################################
##2- Gauss Seidel Method

this method is nearly as the same as jacobi method, we just choose diferent
matrix to iterate the sequence.

let imagine we have a system writen Ax = b 

A : matrix belong to MnR defined positiv
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
b : vector known

##Start solving

so let decompose A = D - E - F

D : Diagonal matrix
E : Triangular inferior Matrix
F : Triangular superior Matrix

we put P = D - E is also a triangular inferior matrix

with P(-1) is the inverse of P,  B = P(-1)F and f = P(-1)b
so the new equation will be (D-E-F)x=b <=>  (D - E)x = Fx + b
                                       <=>       Px = Fx + b
                                       <=>        x = P(-1)Fx + P(-1)b
                                       <=>        x = B x + f

we just need that A to be defined and positiv to have convergence

##3- Gradient Method

Hold yourself Gradient method is caming

Gradient method is easy to implement but difficult to understand, it was
difficult from the book and wikipedia, i will try to explain the idea of 
the theory and then i will just try to explain the algorithme, i  associate
wikepdia links for more explanations https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_du_gradient

############Theorical explanations###########

if you don't hunderstand that part jump to algorithmic exmplanation
 
A : matrix belong to MnR defined positiv and symetric
X : Vector n dimension that we try to find
b : vector known


1-so we have a system Ax = b <=> Ax - b = 0

2- we associate to that system a function from R^n to R which represent 
the enrergy of the system, this function is E(x) = 1/2 x(T)Ax - x(T)b  | with x(T) means transposed of x

that E(x) has a particularity tat grad(E(x)) = Ax - b, it's our system

so a max level or minimum level of E will traduce E(x)' = 0 <=> E(x)' . dl = gard(E(x)) . dOM =0
                                                            <=> grad(E(x))  = 0 
---->dl = dx1 * dx2 * .. *dxn (those are scalars)
---->dOM = dx1 + dx2 + .. +dxn (those are vectors)


we imagine that each level of energy correspond to a curve for example an eleptycal one in 2 dimension x1, y1

each level represent an energy or a potential, and whetever we are in a finit position in space we belong to a 
level of energy, the idea is to go from the level that correspond to (x1,y1) to the level below that correspond
to the level (x2,y2) until beeing in the minimul Level where we have grad(E(xmin,ymin)) = 0
   
so we in that process we will have the equation Xn+1 - Xn = - ak grad(E(Xn)) 
we will iterate until grad(E(Xn)) --> 0

############Algorithmic explanations###########

as in the previous method we have sequence that converge

Un+1 - Un = - ak grad(E(Un))

we put r = grad(E(Un) r the residu

with ak have a specefic value ak = rk(T) * rk / rk(T) A r(k)
